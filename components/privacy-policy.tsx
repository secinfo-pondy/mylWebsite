                        <p></p><p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the “Shine the Light” law, a California resident who has provided personal data to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California User”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal data to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of Personal Data, upon receipt of a request by a California User, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal data was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal data that were disclosed. However, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its Privacy Policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure or gives customers a mechanism to opt out of having their personal data disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal Data and providing a cost free means to exercise the right. We have opted for this alternative approach. As stated in this Policy, we give customers a mechanism to opt out of having their Personal Data disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of third parties that received your Personal Data for marketing purposes. If you wish to opt-out of sharing your Personal Data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please email us at
